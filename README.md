# aap-lv2-sfizz: sfizz plugin port to AAP using aap-lv2

This repository is an example port of sfizz LV2 plugin to [AAP](https://github.com/atsushieno/android-audio-plugin-framework), using [aap-lv2](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-lv2).

Right now there is no way to specify SFZ file from the plugin. It has to be specified at build time. Take it more like a proof of concept right now.

## Building

`make` should take care of the builds. See our [GitHub Actions script](.github/workflows/actions.yml). for the normative setup.


## Hacking

You will have to alter `DefaultIntruments.sfz` in the sfizz source code to specify whatever you would like to use.

Our `aap_metadata.xml` is generated by `aap-import-lv2-metadata` tool but it is done manually. So every time sfizz submodule is updated, chances are that the metadata needs to be regenerated (or manually fixed).

The dependency Android binaries for libsndfile are built from [android-native-audio-builders](https://github.com/atsushieno/android-native-audio-builders) repository.

`aap-sfizz` directory directly references sfizz's own `CMakeLists.txt` from `build.gradle`.

## Licensing notice

`aap-lv2-sfizz` itself is distributed under the MIT license.

LV2 (repository for the headers) is under the ISC license.

`sfizz` is distributed under the MIT license, but it has dependencies that are under the Apache License 2.0 etc. See [the project repository](https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz) for details. As of v0.1.6, aap-sfizz does not depend on libsndfile anymore.

The entire plugin application bundles `androidaudioplugin-lv2` AAR module from `aap-lv2`, and `androidaudioplugin` AAR module, and is packaged into one application.
